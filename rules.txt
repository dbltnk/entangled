Entangled 

Introduction
Entangled is a 2-player abstract game inspired by the idea of entangled particles. It is played on two 5x5 boards in parallel, in which each space on one board has a corresponding space on the other board (identifiable by the matching symbols).            

Components
Two 5x5 boards
50 stones (25 black, 25 white)

Aim of the game/scoring
The player to score the most points at the end of the game wins. Points are counted at the end of the game by identifying the largest cluster of stones of your colour that are connected orthogonally. For each board, identify your largest cluster and count the number of stones. Add the totals for the two clusters of your colour together for your score. 
                          
Setup
Place 1 black stone on the centre of one board, and one white stone on the centre of the other (as indicated on the boards by a black/ white circle). Black plays first.

On your turn
Place 1 stone of your colour in any available space on one board, and also place a second stone of your colour on the related space (identified by matching symbol) on the other board. Each player will complete 12 turns. The game ends when white places their final stones and both boards are complete.
